ChangeLog for hostapd

2004-02-08 - v0.1.3
	* fixed event loop to call signal handlers only after returning from
	  the real signal handler
	* reset sta->timeout_next after successful association to make sure
	  that the previously registered inactivity timer will not remove the
	  STA immediately (e.g., if STA deauthenticates and re-associates
	  before the timer is triggered).


Note:

Older changes up to and including v0.1.0 are included in the ChangeLog
of the Host AP driver.
